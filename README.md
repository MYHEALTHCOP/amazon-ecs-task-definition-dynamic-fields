This requirement, create a pain-point for people managing their infrastructure with tools like terraform. You can easily update any parameter in your terraform config and deploy instantly. But this will create drift between your live version and the copy in version control. This action is designed to overcome this pain. It first downloads the latest active revision of your task definition, fills in the specified fields and uploads it back to you ECS as new revision.
